A simple mod that removes the cost multiplier for the research of repeatable projects and end-game global technologies in Terra Invicta.

It requires Unity Mod Manager to work (install using DoorstopProxy): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21

It can be safely added or removed during an ongoing campaign.

In addition, as a small optimization, it avoids adding the completed repeatable projects to various data structures to reduce late-game lag a tiny little bit. Keep in mind that the mod doesn't remove completed projects which had been completed before it had been installed and activated. There's no point to do the same for global technologies: Their repeated completion is tracked with simple per-tech counters.
